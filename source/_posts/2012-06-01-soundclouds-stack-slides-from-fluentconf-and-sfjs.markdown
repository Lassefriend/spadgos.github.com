This week, I've been at the [Fluent Conference][fluent] in San Francisco. It's O'Reilly's first javascript conference, and it brought in some really large names in the field including Steve Souders, Brendan Eich, Ward Cunningham, Paul Irish, Lea Verou... and me.

I was doing just a short presentation on the Share Your Stack line of talks, and so I was discussing what we've used and how we've built [The Next SoundCloud][next]. I was also quite honoured to be contacted by Dave Nugent and Andrew de Andrade from the [San Francisco JS Users' group][sfjs] who asked me to give a talk there too. I don't know why, but I was kind of expecting a medium-ish sized crowd, and that I'd be on for 20-30 minutes or so. Turns out there were over 300 people and my slot was for an hour. Cool (gulp).

Anyway, I think it went really well and I got to talk to a lot of really interesting developers doing some really cool stuff. Due to popular demand, I'm uploading the slides I used for the talk. First of all, I hope they work on your computer (interoperability wasn't a key concern at the time), and that they make some sense. For my actual talk, I had embedded soundcloud.com into the presentation using iframes, but this won't work for you unless you're already in the beta, so I've replaced them with static images. You'll just have to imagine all the awesomeness of it.

You can take a look at the slides here: [SoundCloud's Stack][slides].

Coming shortly, I'll be writing a blog post for [SoundCloud Backstage][backstage], and probably write another post here with more in-depth details about some of the techniques I spoke about in the talks.

PS: Due to all the people I spoke to mocking my luddite ways, I finally caved and created a Twitter account: [@spadgos][twitter]
