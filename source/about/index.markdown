Hi.
----

I'm Nick Fisher. I live in Berlin and work at [SoundCloud](http://soundcloud.com) as a front-end developer. Right now, I eat, live and breathe Javascript, but I also was a PHP/MySQL guy in a previous life. When I'm being nerdy in my spare time, I hack around with some plugins for [Sublime Text 2][sublime], plus some other Javascript stuff, including NodeJS. I also spend some time on [Stack Overflow][nickf].

Here are some of my projects which you can find on [Github][github]:

- **[Tyrtle][tyrtle]**, a Javascript unit testing framework for the browser and node
- **[Myrtle][myrtle]**, a Javascript mocking framework
- **[Record][record]**, a PHP ORM class
- Sublime Text Plugins
    - **[JSDocs][jsdocs]**, gives assistance while writing javadoc-style comments in Javascript and PHP
    - **[AsAbove][asabove]**, plugin to duplicate the character in the line above your cursor
    - **[ToggleQuotes][toggle]**, makes switching the quote characters on strings super easy
    - **[OpenRecentFiles][openrecent]**, does what it says!
    - **[DefaultFileType][default]**, opens new files with the same type as the current file

Spadgos?
--------

Good question! Firstly, it's pronounced "spad-joss". Spadgos as a word doesn't mean anything, it's just a word [a friend of mine][pospi] made up, and now I tend to use it since you can be guaranteed no one has taken that username before you.

You can send me an email at spadgos at google's mail service.
